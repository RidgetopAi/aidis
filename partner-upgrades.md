üéØ GREAT question! Let me give you honest UX feedback, acknowledging my "contamination":

What I know about AIDIS when I load up:

   * From AGENT.md: It's a "context management platform" with 37 MCP tools
   * The concept: AI agents storing/retrieving memories across sessions
   * Tool categories: System, Context, Projects, Naming, etc.
   * Parameter specs (which saved us today!)

Does it feel natural/easy to use?

‚úÖ NATURAL aspects:

   * Tool naming is intuitive: context_store, project_current, naming_check - I can guess what they do
   * Responses are excellent: Well-formatted, informative, consistent emoji/structure
   * Categories make sense: Logical grouping of functionality
   * The core concept clicks: "AI memory system" is immediately understandable

‚ùå CONFUSING aspects:

   * Parameter guessing: Without AGENT.md, I'd be guessing parameter names constantly
   * Error messages misleading: "proposedName required" when tool actually wants "name"
   * No discovery mechanism: How would I know what tools exist without documentation?
   * Hidden complexity: Database connection issues, but user has no visibility into what's wrong

üéØ What would make it MORE natural:

   1. Self-describing tools: mcp__aidis__help or context_store --help
   2. Better error messages: "Expected: proposedName (string), entityType (string). Got: name, type"
   3. Onboarding flow: New users need a "getting started" path
   4. Status visibility: When things break, show me what's actually wrong

HONEST ASSESSMENT: The core UX is solid, but it needs error handling polish and discoverability features before it's truly
user-friendly.

For FloorBuddy: You'll want users to focus on their work, not debugging AIDIS. The memory system should be invisible when it
works, helpful when it doesn't.

Your instinct is right - get the UX foundation solid now! üéØ
