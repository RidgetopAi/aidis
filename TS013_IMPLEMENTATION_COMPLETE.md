## Migration Process

### Phase 1: Pre-Migration Analysis
```bash
# Analyze current state and create migration plan
npx tsx backfillSessions.ts --dry-run --report
```

**Analysis Output:**
- Orphan session count and categorization
- Confidence levels for each assignment
- Risk assessment and recommendations
- Detailed migration plan with backup strategies

### Phase 2: Migration Execution
```bash
# Execute migration with safety features
npx tsx backfillSessions.ts --interactive

# Or skip low-confidence assignments
npx tsx backfillSessions.ts --skip-low-confidence
```

**Safety Features Active:**
- Automatic database backup creation
- TS012 validation for each session switch
- Transaction-based operations with rollback
- Real-time progress monitoring and error handling

### Phase 3: Verification and Rollback (if needed)
```bash
# Verify migration results
npx tsx backfillSessions.ts --dry-run  # Should show 0 orphan sessions

# Rollback if issues found
npx tsx rollbackMigration.ts <migration-id> --verify
```

## Architecture Integration

### TS012 Validation Framework Integration
- **Pre-Migration**: Validates session state and target project compatibility
- **During Migration**: Ensures atomic operations with rollback capability
- **Post-Migration**: Verifies migration completeness and state consistency

### Database Schema Considerations
- **Backup Tables**: `sessions_backup_<migration_id>` for rollback capability
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Maintains referential integrity throughout migration
- **Transaction Isolation**: Prevents concurrent modification conflicts

### Session Management Ecosystem
- **TS008**: Session lifecycle management compatibility
- **TS009**: Session recovery system integration
- **TS010**: Session hierarchy preservation
- **TS011**: Session inheritance maintenance
- **TS012**: Comprehensive validation framework

## Migration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Confident Assignment (>90% confidence)
```
Session: abc123-def4...
Analytics Events: 15 events, all pointing to project "frontend-app"
Assignment: Confident → frontend-app
Action: Migrate immediately with TS012 validation
```

### Scenario 2: Tentative Assignment (60-90% confidence)
```
Session: def456-abc7...
Analytics Events: 8 events, 6 → "api-service", 2 → "frontend-app"
Assignment: Tentative → api-service (75% confidence)
Action: Migrate with warning, or skip if --skip-low-confidence
```

### Scenario 3: Manual Review (<60% confidence)
```
Session: ghi789-jkl0...
Analytics Events: 12 events across 4 different projects
Assignment: Manual Review Required
Action: Skip in automated migration, flag for manual review
```

### Scenario 4: Unassigned (no project events)
```
Session: mno123-pqr4...
Analytics Events: 3 events, all with project_id = NULL
Assignment: Unassigned → 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
Action: Mark as unassigned with sentinel project ID
```
