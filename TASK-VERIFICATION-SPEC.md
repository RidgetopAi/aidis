"Before we move on, create a verification handoff package containing:

1. **Implementation Summary**: What exactly was implemented (be specific about functions, endpoints, files modified)

2. **Requirements Mapping**: For each original requirement, state exactly where/how it was implemented

3. **Integration Points**: List all the places this feature connects to existing code

4. **Expected Behavior**: Step-by-step description of how the feature should work end-to-end

5. **Critical Dependencies**: What other parts of the system this relies on

6. **Test Scenarios**: Key flows that should work if implementation is complete"
