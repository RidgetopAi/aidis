# Phase 5 Verification – QA Re-check

## Summary
Re-testing shows the Phase 5 implementation now integrates the new V2 MCP API, enhanced validation, error-boundary handling, and an executable fuzz framework. Live requests against `/v2/mcp/*` succeed, XSS payloads are blocked, and the fuzz runner passes 100 iterations locally. One requirement remains only partially met: the parser still relies on `JSON.parse` with Zod validation rather than the nearley grammar promised in the Oracle plan, although a rationale is documented.

## Confirmed Fixes

1. **V2 API exposed and functional**
   - `mcp-server/src/server.ts:500` routes `/v2/mcp/*` traffic into `handleV2McpRequest`, and the simulated router in `mcp-server/src/server.ts:646` serves health/list/tool endpoints.
   - `curl http://localhost:8080/v2/mcp/health` now returns a healthy payload (timestamp 2025-09-21T18:13:47Z).
   - Posting to the tool endpoint (`curl -X POST …/v2/mcp/tools/project_list`) yields a structured response with version metadata and request ID.

2. **Enhanced ingress validation in use**
   - Tool executions through `/v2/mcp/tools/...` call `IngressValidator.validateIngressRequest` with sanitization (`mcp-server/src/server.ts:692-707`).
   - Malicious input such as `<script>alert(1)</script>` is rejected with a suspicious-pattern error, confirming the XSS filter is active.

3. **Error boundaries wired in**
   - Responses from V2 endpoints flow through `McpResponseHandler.processResponse` (`mcp-server/src/server.ts:724-736`), so retry logic and structured errors now execute on real requests.

4. **Executable fuzz testing**
   - `run-fuzz-tests.ts:1-83` adds a CLI runner that writes results to `fuzz-results/`.
   - Running `npx tsx run-fuzz-tests.ts smoke` completes 100/100 iterations with no crashes (327 tests/sec), demonstrating a working harness.

5. **Implementation documentation updated**
   - `mcp-server/src/parsers/PARSER_APPROACH.md:1` records the decision to favor TypeScript+Zod over nearley and details the added safeguards (size limits, nesting limits, content validation).

## Residual Risk / Follow-up

- **Parser requirement not fully satisfied**: `McpParser.parseResponse` still delegates to `JSON.parse` before applying Zod schemas (`mcp-server/src/parsers/mcpParser.ts:62-107`). The nearley grammar file remains unused, and no `nearley` dependency exists. If the Phase 5 acceptance criteria strictly require a nearley-based parser, either the implementation should be updated accordingly or a formal decision record should note the scope change.

- **Legacy `/mcp/tools` path**: The older HTTP bridge continues to rely on `validationMiddleware` (`mcp-server/src/server.ts:780-789`). That is acceptable if V2 is the intended hardened surface, but keep in mind the original path doesn’t benefit from the new checks.

## Recommendation
With the above caveat on the parser requirement, Phase 5 can be considered functionally complete. Please confirm whether the documented parser approach is an approved deviation; if not, plan a follow-on task to deliver the nearley grammar implementation.
