## Implementation Effort by Category

### Low Effort (Easy)
- ✅ Session goals/tags (Add columns + simple methods)
- ✅ Enhanced task tracking (Add 2 columns)
- ✅ AI model/provider tracking (Add columns)
- ✅ Productivity score (Pure calculation)
- ✅ Duration column (Calculated field)

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 days

### Medium Effort (Moderate)
- 🟡 LOC tracking (Git diff integration + error handling)
- 🟡 Activity timeline (New table + integration points)
- 🟡 File tracking (New table + tool integration)
- 🟡 Session reporting (Complex queries + formatting)

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 weeks

### High Effort (Complex)
- ⚠️ Session statistics (Aggregate queries, multiple views)
- ⚠️ Pattern detection (Time analysis, correlations)

**Estimated Time:** 1 week

**Total Estimated Time:** 3-4 weeks implementation + 1 week testing = **4-5 weeks**

---

## Risk Assessment by Feature

### Zero Risk (Safe)
- Session goals/tags
- Enhanced task tracking
- AI model tracking
- Productivity score
- Duration column
- Reporting enhancements

**Why Safe:** Adding optional fields, no changes to existing logic

### Low Risk (Minimal)
- Activity timeline table
- File tracking table
- Database indexes

**Why Low:** New tables don't affect existing sessions

### Medium Risk (Manageable)
- LOC tracking (git integration)
- Activity integration (multiple touch points)

**Why Medium:** Integration with external system (git), multiple code changes

### High Risk (None!)
- **Zero high-risk features** - Everything is incremental enhancement

2. Core management is 100% complete
3. Project assignment is 100% complete
4. Metrics tracking is 67% complete
5. No high-risk features to build

**Moderate News:**
1. Activity timeline is 0% (but planned well)
2. File tracking is 0% (but straightforward)
3. Reporting is 10% (needs the most work)

**Bottom Line:**
- **Core system is solid** - Sessions work, tracking works
- **Enhancements are logical** - Build on what exists
- **Risk is minimal** - Incremental, non-breaking changes
- **Timeline is reasonable** - 4-6 weeks for 36 new features

## Priority Recommendation

### High Priority (Partner's Top Wants)
1. LOC tracking - Most requested in action plan
2. Session goals - Intentional work tracking
3. Productivity score - Key metric for insights
4. Activity timeline - Understanding what happened
5. Enhanced reporting - Making data actionable

### Medium Priority (Nice to Have)
1. File tracking - Useful but not critical
2. Session statistics - Long-term value
3. Tags - Organization helper

### Low Priority (Can Wait)
1. Pattern detection - Advanced analytics
2. Session comparison - Power user feature
3. AI model tracking - Informational only

**Phase 2 Covers All High Priority Items**
