# Todo 09/24/25 

* [ ] Add to aidis command ability for user to enter a context.
* [ ] Add a export context functions need to be able to export single and bulk (bulk can be done with filter but see below) .md,.txt and if possible pdf would be nice for quick processing online? 
* [ ] The Share button on each context card in Context page is kind of useless for our purposes it points to the localhost....I like the idea of being able to quick share but now not useable. 
* [x] Contex Filter - Actions/select all bar is overlaying the filter menu and it's looping (flashing) the number of contexts....also when trying to type in search bar again it seems like a loop running in background that won't let keystroke register when typing.
* [ ] Need an actual semantic search bar or menu for Context and actually entire db....Need to add a Search page so can search patterns and use the semantic search capabilities. (refine this idea before proceeding)
* [ ] Need to redo layout of search....too much empty space below and to crowded up top with horizontal layout
