AIDIS COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM REVIEW  
(Assessment date 2025-08-20)

──────────────────────── SYSTEM HEALTH SNAPSHOT ────────────────────────
Overall grade: B  (Stable core, but configuration drift & test coverage gaps)

• 37 MCP tools defined – 28 pass (76 %).  
• 2 categories already at 100 % (Project Management, Naming Registry).  
• Server uptime, graceful shutdown, and circuit-breaker logic validated.  
• Database connectivity, pgvector extension, and embedding service pass all tests.  

Key risk: configuration divergence between code, compiled artefacts and the several PostgreSQL databases created during development. This is the root of the stubborn "milestone" failure and will keep re-surfacing until structural hygiene is restored.

──────────────────────── ROOT-CAUSE ANALYSIS – "MILESTONE" BUG ────────────────────────
Symptom  
• context_store works for six types but fails for type=milestone with "invalid enum value" even though direct SQL insert succeeds.

True root cause = configuration DRIFT, not validation.

1. Code-side  
   – validation.ts already includes 'milestone'.  
   – StoreContextRequest in context.ts is still missing 'milestone', but that is compile-time only; at runtime no enum check occurs.  

2. DB-side  
   – You have at least two physical databases:
     • aidis_development  (default when DATABASE_NAME unset)  
     • aidis_production   (target of recent migration)  
   – In aidis_production the enum or CHECK constraint was altered to include 'milestone'.  
   – The running server process is still connected to aidis_development (or "aidis_ui_dev"), where the enum was never altered, therefore INSERT … context_type='milestone' fails.  
   – Your manual "direct DB insert" was executed against aidis_production, so it appeared to work.

3. "Old compiled JS" in dist/ just masked the issue earlier; runtime with tsx now bypasses it, but the underlying DB mismatch remains.

Fix in three steps  
a. Decide which database is canonical (recommend aidis_production).  
b. In .env set DATABASE_NAME=aidis_production for every runtime context (unit tests, dev server, systemd service).  
c. Drop or migrate the obsolete dev DBs, or at minimum add a safety banner / login_message to prevent accidental connections.

Optional hardening: Use a single DATABASE_URL rather than piecemeal vars; apply dotenv-safe to guarantee presence.

──────────────────────── CRITICAL ISSUES & RECOMMENDATIONS ────────────────────────
1. Configuration consistency (Highest priority)  
   • Consolidate .env files. Keep one per environment: .env.development, .env.test, .env.production.  
   • Remove default 'aidis_development' fallback; fail fast if DATABASE_NAME not supplied.  
   • Add a startup banner logging exactly which DB, host, user and migration version are in use.  
   • Enforce NODE_ENV-specific builds: tsx for dev, compiled dist for prod; never a mix.

2. Schema/Code single-source-of-truth  
   • The context_type enum now lives in three places: Postgres TYPE, validation.ts, and TypeScript union. Adopt a shared ddl-constants file or a migration tool (e.g. Prisma, Drizzle, Sqitch) that can generate both DB migrations and TS enums.  
   • Add a boot-time assertion that every allowed value in validation.ts exists in the DB enum.

3. Migration discipline  
   • Migrations should be idempotent and versioned; the table _aidis_migrations exists but the enum alteration evidently ran only on one DB.   -> Introduce CI check that fails if HEAD migration is not present in all configured DBs.  
   • Add a post-deploy smoke test suite that runs all MCP tools against staging.

4. Test coverage gaps  
   • 9 tools still unverified. Convert PHASE_3_TOOL_STATUS_REPORT into an automated Jest/Vitest test matrix.  
   • Each tool invocation should be part of CI with isolated DB fixture/teardown.

5. Old artefacts & runtime ambiguity  
   • dist/ folder should be in .gitignore and purged in clean script.  
   • Production build should run `rimraf dist && tsc -p tsconfig.prod.json` then `node dist/server.js`.  
   • Development should run `tsx watch src/server.ts`. Never mix.

6. Performance & scaling  
   • connection pool max=20 is fine for dev; in prod measure with pg_stat_activity and adjust.  
   • Indexes: ensure btree on contexts(project_id, context_type) and GIN on tags array. Add ivfflat index on embedding once pgvector v0.5 is installed for large datasets.  
   • Embedding dimension logged as 384 in AGENT.md but contextHandler assumes 1536 in vector_test. Align dimensions or storage will waste RAM/disk.

7. Security & observability  
   • Add pgbouncer or RDS proxy before going multi-agent at scale.  
   • Emit OpenTelemetry traces around every MCP handler to surface slow queries.  
   • Add rate-limit middleware before exposing externally.

──────────────────────── HIDDEN RISKS & TECHNICAL DEBT ────────────────────────
• Multiple databases with partially-run migrations (primary risk).  
• Enum duplication across layers.  
• Lack of integration tests for agent_* and code_* tool set – behaviour unverified.  
• Code style/formatting uneven after many quick patches; run eslint --fix and prettier pre-commit.  
• Embedding service presently single-threaded; heavy concurrent context_store calls will block event loop.

──────────────────────── CONFIDENCE & PATH TO 100 % ────────────────────────
Confidence of reaching 100 % tool pass rate after the alignment work: ≈ 85 %.  
Estimated effort: 1-2 focused days

Roadmap to 100 %  
1. Lock server onto aidis_production DB and delete/rename others (2 h).  
2. Re-run migrations on prod DB to be absolutely current (30 m).  
3. Build automated test harness that hits every MCP tool (4-6 h).  
4. Fix remaining validation/schema drift uncovered by tests (2-3 h).  
5. CI/CD pipeline gate: build->migrate->run tool tests->deploy (1 h).

──────────────────────── EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ────────────────────────
The core architecture of AIDIS is sound and already delivering real value. Most apparent "weird" behaviours stem from environment fragmentation rather than code logic. By unifying configuration, enforcing a single migration path, and automating full-stack tests, you will eliminate the remaining 24 % failure rate quickly and gain the confidence to move into Phase 4 polish and wider adoption.

Next action for Brian tonight:  
1. Edit .env → DATABASE_NAME=aidis_production (or full DATABASE_URL).  
2. Restart server, re-test context_store with type=milestone – it should succeed.  
3. Commit & push a script `scripts/assert-db-alignment.ts` that compares validation enums with DB enum values and fails if out of sync.

Once configuration hygiene is restored, AIDIS is in excellent shape for the final push.
