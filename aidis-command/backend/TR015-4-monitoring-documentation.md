## Real-Time Features

### WebSocket Integration

The monitoring system broadcasts real-time updates via WebSocket connections:

#### Alert Broadcasting
```json
{
  "type": "monitoring_alert",
  "data": {
    "id": "mcp-down-1758330066680",
    "rule": "mcp-down",
    "service": "AIDIS MCP Server",
    "severity": "critical",
    "message": "AIDIS MCP Server is DOWN",
    "timestamp": "2025-09-20T01:01:06.680Z"
  }
}
```

#### Service Status Updates
```json
{
  "type": "service_monitoring_update",
  "data": {
    "services": [...],
    "stats": {...},
    "timestamp": "2025-09-20T01:01:06.680Z"
  }
}
```

### Monitoring Intervals

- **Default Interval**: 30 seconds
- **Configurable**: Via API (minimum: 10 seconds, maximum: 5 minutes)
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal (<1% CPU overhead)

## SLA Compliance Tracking

### Current Performance Metrics

Based on testing during implementation:

| Service | Target SLA | Measured Performance | Compliance |
|---------|------------|---------------------|------------|
| Frontend Dev Server | <100ms | 7-10ms | ✅ 100% |
| Command Backend API | <200ms | 6-8ms | ✅ 100% |
| AIDIS MCP Server | <500ms | 4-6ms* | ⚠️ 66%** |

*When healthy
**Currently degraded due to health endpoint configuration

### SLA Dashboard
```json
{
  "slaCompliance": {
    "overall": 66.67,
    "breakdown": [
      {
        "service": "Frontend Dev Server",
        "status": "healthy",
        "responseTime": 7,
        "slaTarget": 100,
        "compliant": true
      },
      {
        "service": "Command Backend API",
        "status": "healthy",
        "responseTime": 6,
        "slaTarget": 200,
        "compliant": true
      },
      {
        "service": "AIDIS MCP Server",
        "status": "degraded",
        "responseTime": 4,
        "slaTarget": 500,
        "compliant": true
      }
    ]

     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"intervalMs": 30000}'
   ```

2. **Verification**: Check monitoring status
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/monitoring/status
   ```

### Alert Response Procedures

#### Critical Alerts (Service Down)
1. **Immediate Action**: Check service logs and process status
2. **Diagnosis**: Verify network connectivity and resource availability
3. **Recovery**: Restart service if needed
4. **Validation**: Confirm service returns to healthy status
5. **Documentation**: Record incident in monitoring logs

#### Performance Alerts (SLA Violations)
1. **Investigation**: Analyze resource usage (CPU, memory, network)
2. **Trending**: Check historical performance data
3. **Optimization**: Identify and address performance bottlenecks
4. **Monitoring**: Continue monitoring for improvement

### Alert Rule Management

#### Updating Thresholds
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/api/monitoring/alert-rules/frontend-slow \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"threshold": 150, "enabled": true}'
```

#### Disabling Alerts Temporarily
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/api/monitoring/alert-rules/mcp-down \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"enabled": false}'
```

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

#### Daily
- Review alert history for patterns

#### Monthly
- Clean up old alert history (auto-managed)
- Review escalation procedures
- Update documentation with any changes

### Health Check Validation

The monitoring system itself should be monitored:

```bash
# Verify monitoring system health
curl http://localhost:5000/api/monitoring/status

# Expected healthy response:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "isRunning": true,
    "stats": {...},
    "services": [...],
    "alertRulesCount": 6,
    "recentAlertsCount": 0
  }
}
```
