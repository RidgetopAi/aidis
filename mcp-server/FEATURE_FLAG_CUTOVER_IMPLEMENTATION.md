# AIDIS Feature Flag Cutover System Implementation

## P2.3 Final Phase: Zero-Downtime Migration Complete

**Date**: 2025-09-17
**Migration**: 025_implement_feature_flag_cutover.sql
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED
**All Tests**: PASSING

## Overview

This implementation completes the AIDIS Oracle refactoring project Phase 2.3 by providing a production-ready feature flag cutover system for gradual, controlled migration from primary to shadow tables with zero downtime.

## Architecture Summary

### Three-Layer Migration Strategy (Complete)

1. **✅ Migration 023**: Shadow table creation with metadata
2. **✅ Migration 024**: Dual-write validation system
3. **✅ Migration 025**: Feature flag cutover system (THIS IMPLEMENTATION)

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Traffic Routing Configuration System
- **Table**: `traffic_routing_config`
- **Per-table cutover control** with granular settings
- **Health monitoring thresholds** and safety mechanisms
- **Stage progression tracking** with time-based eligibility

### 2. Gradual Cutover Stages
```
disabled → dual_write → test_1 → test_10 → half_50 → full_100 → completed
   0%        0%         1%       10%       50%       100%      100%
```

### 3. Core Control Functions
- `start_gradual_cutover(table_name, duration_minutes)` - Begin cutover process
- `advance_cutover_stage(table_name, force_flag)` - Progress to next stage
- `complete_cutover(table_name, confirm_flag)` - Finalize migration
- `emergency_rollback(table_name, reason)` - Instant rollback

### 4. Monitoring and Safety
- **Real-time health monitoring** with configurable thresholds
- **Performance metrics tracking** per operation type
- **Data consistency validation** integration
- **Automated safety checks** with auto-rollback
- **Emergency stop capabilities** (per-table and system-wide)

### 5. Traffic Routing Logic
- `should_route_to_shadow(table_name, operation_type)` - Routing decisions
- **Percentage-based read routing** with randomization
- **Write operation control** with shadow enable/disable
- **Health-based routing override** for safety

Dashboard Query Test: PASS - Dashboard query working
```

### Workflow Tests: ALL PASSING ✅

```
✅ Start gradual cutover: dual_write stage (0% reads)
✅ Advance to test_1 stage: 1% reads to shadow
✅ Emergency rollback: Instant reversion to primary
✅ Status monitoring: Real-time dashboard updates
✅ Traffic routing: Correct percentage-based decisions
```

## Usage Examples

### Starting Production Cutover
```sql
-- 1. Start with most critical table first (lowest risk)
SELECT start_gradual_cutover('projects', 60); -- 60-minute stages

-- 2. Monitor status
SELECT * FROM get_cutover_status_dashboard() WHERE table_name = 'projects';

-- 3. Advance when ready (after validation period)
SELECT advance_cutover_stage('projects'); -- Requires health checks

-- 4. Continue through all stages: test_1 → test_10 → half_50 → full_100

-- 5. Complete cutover (after final validation)
SELECT complete_cutover('projects', TRUE);
```

### Emergency Procedures
```sql
-- Individual table emergency rollback
SELECT emergency_rollback('projects', 'Performance degradation detected');

-- System-wide emergency stop
SELECT emergency_stop_all_cutover('Critical database issue');

-- Check all system status
SELECT * FROM get_cutover_status_dashboard();
```

### Monitoring and Analytics
```sql
-- Performance summary
SELECT * FROM get_dual_write_performance_summary(24);

-- Health checks
SELECT * FROM perform_cutover_health_check('projects');

-- Comprehensive report
SELECT * FROM generate_cutover_report('projects', 24);

-- Automated safety checks
SELECT * FROM run_automated_safety_check();
```

## Production Deployment Strategy

### Recommended Cutover Order
1. **`projects`** - Lowest volume, foundational table
2. **`sessions`** - Medium volume, session tracking
3. **`tasks`** - Administrative data, medium risk
4. **`analytics_events`** - High volume, monitoring impact
5. **`contexts`** - Highest volume, most critical

### Stage Duration Recommendations
- **dual_write**: 24-48 hours (validate dual-write stability)
- **test_1**: 12-24 hours (monitor 1% traffic impact)
- **test_10**: 6-12 hours (validate 10% performance)
- **half_50**: 4-8 hours (major performance validation)
- **full_100**: 2-4 hours (final validation before cutover)

### Validation Requirements
- **Error rate**: < 0.1% for advancement
- **Latency increase**: < 10% for advancement
- **Data consistency**: > 99.5% validation score
- **Performance monitoring**: Continuous during each stage

## Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback (Production)
```sql
-- Immediate rollback for critical issues
SELECT emergency_rollback('table_name', 'Critical performance issue');
```

### Complete System Rollback (If Needed)
```sql
-- Full system rollback (confirmation required)
SELECT rollback_cutover_system(p_confirm_rollback := TRUE);
```

### State Reset (For Testing)
```sql
-- Reset table to disabled state
SELECT reset_cutover_state('table_name', p_confirm_reset := TRUE);
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Dual-Write System Integration
- Leverages existing `dual_write_config` table
- Uses existing `dual_write_stats` for metrics
- Integrates with `enable_dual_write()` and `disable_dual_write()` functions

### Shadow Table Compatibility
- Works with all 5 shadow tables from migration 023
- Uses existing `validate_table_consistency()` function
- Leverages shadow table metadata for validation

### Application Integration Points
```sql
-- Application code can query routing decisions
SELECT should_route_to_shadow('contexts', 'read') as use_shadow;

-- Application can record operation metrics
SELECT record_cutover_operation('contexts', 'read', 45, TRUE, FALSE);
```

## Monitoring Integration

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Traffic distribution**: Percentage routing to shadow tables
- **Performance impact**: Latency increases during cutover
- **Error rates**: Operation failures during migration
- **Data consistency**: Validation scores across tables
- **Health status**: Overall system health during cutover

### Alerting Triggers
- Error rate > 1% (configurable per table)
- Latency increase > 20% (configurable per table)
- Validation score < 99% (configurable per table)
- Consecutive health failures > 3
- Emergency stop activation

## Security and Compliance

### Audit Trail
- All cutover operations logged with user attribution
- Complete timeline of stage progressions
- Emergency actions with reason codes
- Performance metrics for compliance reporting

### Data Protection
- Zero data loss design with validation at each stage
- Immediate rollback capabilities preserve data integrity
- Shadow table isolation prevents corruption
- Comprehensive validation before each advancement

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Extensions
1. **Automated stage progression** based on health metrics
2. **Blue-green deployment** integration for applications
3. **Load balancer integration** for transparent routing
4. **Real-time monitoring dashboard** with visualizations
5. **Machine learning** for predictive failure detection

### Maintenance Considerations
1. **Metrics retention**: Configure cleanup for `cutover_performance_metrics`
2. **Configuration tuning**: Adjust thresholds based on production experience
3. **Index maintenance**: Monitor query performance as data grows
4. **Function optimization**: Enhance performance as needed
