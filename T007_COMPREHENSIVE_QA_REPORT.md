### ⚠️ Issues Found & Recommendations

#### 1. WebSocket Authentication (Priority: Medium)
**Issue**: WebSocket connections failing with 401 authentication errors
```
❌ WebSocket Error: Unexpected server response: 401
```
**Impact**: Real-time updates not working
**Recommendation**: Fix WebSocket token validation in backend service

#### 2. Error Handling Consistency (Priority: Medium) 
**Issue**: Server returning 500 errors for non-existent resources instead of 404
```
❌ 404 Handling: Unexpected status: 500
```
**Impact**: Poor error user experience
**Recommendation**: Add proper 404 handling for missing agents/resources

#### 3. Data Validation Enhancement (Priority: Low)
**Issue**: Missing validation for field length limits and enum values
```
❌ Name Length Validation: Should reject overly long names
❌ Status Validation: Should reject invalid status values
```
**Impact**: Potential data quality issues
**Recommendation**: Add frontend and backend validation for data constraints

#### 4. Build Warnings (Priority: Low)
**Issue**: Multiple ESLint warnings for unused imports and missing dependencies
**Impact**: Code quality and potential future bugs
**Recommendation**: Clean up unused imports and fix hook dependencies
