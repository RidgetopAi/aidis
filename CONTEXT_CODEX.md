# CONTEXT CODEX – Phase 6 Progress Snapshot (2025-09-22)

## Scope
This log captures the current state of the Phase 6 UI/Backend Contract Hardening effort. It serves as a hand-off/context file for resuming work tomorrow.

## Key Documents
- `PHASE_6_TASK_BREAKDOWN.md`
- `PHASE_6_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`
- `ORACLE_REFACTOR.md`
- `QA_PHASE_6_VERIFICATION.md`

## Completed Work (today)
1. **TR001-6 / TR005-6 Alignment**
   - `aidis-command/frontend/src/api/client.ts` now initializes the OpenAPI client at startup, using `aidis_token` for auth.
   - `aidis-command/frontend/src/index.tsx` imports the client bootstrap to ensure configuration before React renders.

2. **TR003-6: Context Contract Migration** _(Phase 6 Task 3.2)_
   - Removed `src/services/contextApi.ts` and replaced it with generated-client wrappers (`src/api/contextsClient.ts`).
   - Added React Query hooks (`src/hooks/useContexts.ts`) and shared helpers (`src/utils/contextHelpers.ts`).
   - Updated context-related UI (cards, filters, stats, detail drawer, bulk actions, pages) to consume the new hooks and typed models.
   - Session detail page now reuses the contexts client for per-session context listings.
   - Store (`src/stores/contextStore.ts`) switched to generated-model types; selection state preserved.

3. **Backend Contract Enforcement**
   - `aidis-command/backend/src/validation/schemas.ts` now defines `UpdateContext`, `ContextBulkDelete`, and `ContextSearchQuery` schemas.
   - `src/routes/contexts.ts` wired validation middleware for search, update, delete, bulk delete, related endpoints.
   - `src/controllers/context.ts` now works with typed updates only.
   - `src/config/openapi.ts` updated with new schemas for update/bulk delete.
   - Regenerated OpenAPI spec + TypeScript client (`npm run generate:openapi`) and refreshed manifest.

4. **Project Picker & Scoped Views**
   - React Query project payload mismatch fixed (`ProjectContext`, `ProjectSwitcher`, `Projects` now read either `projects` or `data.projects`).
   - Generated OpenAPI client pushes `X-Project-ID` header so backend filtering works across contexts/decisions/tasks APIs.
   - Contexts page syncs store filters with `currentProject` and forces stats/search refetch, so contexts are now scoped by the selected project.

5. **Context Log**
   - Stored in AIDIS via `context_store` (type `planning`, tags `phase-6`, `contexts`, `react-query`, `openapi`).

6. **Decision Module React Query Migration**
   - Expanded the decisions OpenAPI contract (query params, response schemas, status enums) and regenerated the typed client.
   - Added `decisionsClient` + `useDecisions` hooks so search/stats/detail flows ride React Query with project scoping.
   - Refactored `Decisions.tsx` to lean on the new hooks, keeping the store in sync while honoring the global project picker.

7. **Naming Registry React Query Migration**
   - Aligned the OpenAPI naming schemas (entries, stats, search responses, availability) with the data we actually emit and regenerated the client.
   - Introduced `namingClient` and `useNaming` hooks covering search, stats, detail, registration, availability, and suggestions.
   - Updated `NamingApi` to delegate to the generated client, and rewired `Naming.tsx`/register workflows to use React Query with project-aware filtering and state syncing.

## Testing
- `npm run build` verified for both frontend and backend (only existing third-party source-map warnings and legacy lint warnings remain).

## Next Steps
Continuing Phase 6 work per `PHASE_6_TASK_BREAKDOWN.md`:
1. **Immediate**: Extend the same client/hook pattern to the monitoring dashboards and embeddings tooling.
2. Tighten the remaining API-backed views and finalize TR004/TR005 validation tasks prior to GitHub cutover.

Pause point: decisions and naming modules now ride the generated clients + React Query; next up is monitoring/embeddings hardening.

## Update (2025-09-23)

### Completed Work
8. **TR003-6: Embedding Analytics Migration**
   - `aidis-command/backend/src/services/EmbeddingService.ts` now accepts a `projectId`/`projectName` scope so similarity, projection, cluster, and metrics queries honor the `X-Project-ID` header.
   - `aidis-command/backend/src/routes/embedding.ts` resolves the active project via middleware, requires `X-Project-ID` for analytics endpoints, and the Swagger docs reference the new response payloads.
   - `aidis-command/backend/src/config/openapi.ts` defines explicit schemas for `EmbeddingSimilarityMatrix`, `EmbeddingProjection`, `EmbeddingClusterResult`, and `EmbeddingQualityMetrics`; regenerated TypeScript client via `npm run generate:openapi`.
   - Frontend now consumes the generated client through `src/api/embeddingsClient.ts` and React Query hooks in `src/hooks/useEmbeddings.ts`; the old `services/embeddingService.ts` has been removed.
   - `SimilarityHeatmap` and `ScatterProjection` render off the new hooks, auto-select the first dataset per project, and surface project-scope/empty-state messaging. The Zustand store (`src/stores/embeddingStore.ts`) now tracks only UI selection state.
   - `SystemMonitoring.tsx` guards optional response fields to satisfy the stricter generated types.
9. **TR003-6: Monitoring Detail Views**
   - Added React Query-powered cards for monitoring statistics, alerts, and performance trends (`MonitoringStats.tsx`, `MonitoringAlerts.tsx`, `MonitoringTrends.tsx`) using the generated monitoring client.
   - Dashboard now renders the new monitoring cards alongside `SystemMonitoring`, providing instant insight into SLA compliance, recent alerts, and response-time trends.
   - Retired `src/services/monitoringApi.ts`; all monitoring data flows through `src/hooks/useMonitoring.ts` and the generated client wrappers.

### Testing
- `npm run build` (frontend) passes, emitting only the known third-party source map warnings.
- `npm run build` (backend) passes after the contract updates.

### Next Steps
1. Port embeddings metrics/cluster visualisations once UI requirements land (hooks already available).
2. Continue trimming legacy `services/*Api.ts` files once all consumers move to React Query.

## Planning Notes (2025-09-23)
- Relevance dashboard: derive hit-rate metrics and low-signal warnings from existing embeddings + context metadata.
- Project relationship map: graph nodes per project with edges based on shared contexts/decisions/tags; target ReactFlow for visual consistency.
- Knowledge gap detection: surface tags/projects with sparse coverage and stale embeddings (age + density heuristics).
- Usage patterns: reuse context search/session data to expose top queries, search modality mix, and demand vs. content density per project.
- All modules scoped per project with 7/30/90-day windows and lightweight auto-refresh (≈60s).

## Update (2025-09-24)

### Current Status
- Project selector parity: contexts, decisions, naming, and dashboard widgets all respect `currentProject`; tasks list still uses the legacy service and remains in the queue.
- Embedding analytics powered by generated client + React Query, with datasets auto-selecting per project and similarity/projection views live in UI.
- Monitoring surface polished with stats/alerts/trends cards; baseline `SystemMonitoring` now defensive against nullable fields from the stricter client.

### Work Completed Today
1. Wired the clustering and quality metrics tabs to the generated embeddings client via new React Query-powered panels (`ClusterAnalysis.tsx`, `QualityMetrics.tsx`), replacing the placeholder cards.
2. Added a shared dataset-selection hook so similarity, projection, clustering, and metrics tabs stay in sync as projects/datasets change.
3. Re-synced the plan with `PHASE_6_TASK_BREAKDOWN.md` to keep Phase 6 Task 3 focused on finishing embeddings + monitoring before tackling the advanced analytics dashboards.
4. Exposed the embeddings workspace in the app shell (new `/embedding` route + sidebar entry) so the analytics panels are directly discoverable in aidis command.
5. Delivered the first analytics milestone: a relevance dashboard endpoint + tab powered by generated clients, covering coverage/high-confidence rates, score distribution, 30-day trend, and top tags (see `EmbeddingService.getRelevanceMetrics`, `/embedding/relevance`, regenerated OpenAPI, `useEmbeddingRelevanceQuery`, and `RelevanceDashboard`).
6. Added the project relationship map: backend aggregates shared context tags per project (`getProjectRelationships`, `/embedding/relationships`) and the frontend renders a React Flow network + detail list through `ProjectRelationshipMap` and `useEmbeddingRelationshipsQuery`.
7. Delivered knowledge-gap analytics and usage-pattern dashboards: new backend metrics (`getKnowledgeGapMetrics`, `getUsagePatterns`, `/embedding/knowledge-gaps`, `/embedding/usage`) with OpenAPI + client updates, plus `KnowledgeGapInsights` and `UsagePatterns` React panels.

### Outstanding / Next Actions
- Extend embeddings analytics with the remaining Phase 6 §3.6 panels (knowledge-gap detection and usage-pattern insights).
- Validate knowledge-gap/usage outputs with real data; tune thresholds for stale tags and type gaps as datasets grow.
- Polish the embeddings settings/3D roadmap tab with concrete configuration hooks once data requirements land.
- Migrate the Tasks page to the generated client for consistent project scoping after embeddings analytics are signed off.
