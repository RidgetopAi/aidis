# DC-VIZ Phase 5 - Spotify Integration TODO

## ✅ TV031-5: Get Audio Features (BPM, energy, tempo)
- [x] Add `getAudioFeatures(trackId)` method to SpotifyAPI.js
  - [x] Endpoint: `https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-features/{trackId}`
  - [x] Returns: tempo (BPM), energy, danceability, valence, etc.
  - [x] Extract BPM from `tempo` field
- [x] Update `getCurrentlyPlaying()` to include track ID
  - [x] Store track ID from response
  - [x] Auto-fetch audio features when track changes

## ✅ TV032-5: Create Metadata Overlay UI
- [x] Create `src/SpotifyOverlay.js`
- [x] Overlay elements (HTML/CSS):
  - [x] Track name
  - [x] Artist name(s)
  - [x] Album artwork (small, corner or bottom)
  - [x] BPM display (optional)
  - [x] Fade in/out on track changes
- [x] Positioning:
  - [x] Bottom-left corner
  - [x] Semi-transparent background with backdrop blur
  - [x] Doesn't obstruct main visuals
- [x] Auto-update:
  - [x] Poll `getCurrentlyPlaying()` every 5 seconds
  - [x] Update overlay when track changes
  - [x] Auto-hide after 10 seconds

## ✅ TV033-5: Sync Visual Effects to BPM
- [x] Create `src/BPMSync.js` class
- [x] Add BPM pulse generator:
  - [x] Convert BPM to milliseconds per beat: `60000 / BPM`
  - [x] Create pulse timer/oscillator
  - [x] Generate 0-1 pulse value synchronized to beat
  - [x] Multiple pulse modes (smooth, trigger, alternating)
- [x] Expose to scenes:
  - [x] Add BPMSync to AudioEngine
  - [x] Pass pulse value to scenes via `audioBands.bpm`
  - [x] Fallback to bass reactivity when disabled
- [x] Integration:
  - [x] Update GUI to show BPM value
  - [x] Toggle to enable/disable BPM sync
  - [x] Automatic BPM detection from Spotify tracks
  - [x] Smooth BPM pulse (sine wave oscillator)

## Build Status
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes
- [x] Vite build successful
- [x] Production ready

## Implementation Summary

### Files Created:
1. **src/SpotifyOverlay.js** (207 lines)
   - Metadata overlay with artwork, track info, BPM
   - Auto-polling every 5 seconds
   - Fade in/out animations
   - Bottom-left positioning with semi-transparent background

2. **src/BPMSync.js** (118 lines)
   - BPM-synchronized pulse generator
   - Multiple pulse modes (smooth sine, sharp trigger, alternating)
   - Bass reactivity fallback
   - Configurable enable/disable

### Files Modified:
1. **src/SpotifyAPI.js**
   - Added `getAudioFeatures(trackId)` method
   - Updated `getCurrentlyPlaying()` to include track ID
   - Auto-fetch audio features for tracks

2. **src/AudioEngine.js**
   - Imported BPMSync class
   - Added `bpm` property to `bands` object
   - Update BPM pulse value in `update()` method
   - Set bass fallback for when BPM sync is disabled

3. **src/main.js**
   - Imported SpotifyOverlay
   - Initialize SpotifyOverlay on startup
   - Setup BPM sync polling (every 10 seconds)
   - Auto-update BPM when track changes

4. **src/controls.js**
   - Added BPM sync controls to Spotify folder
   - Display current BPM (updates every 1 second)
   - Toggle to enable/disable BPM sync
   - Update BPM display when track changes

### Features Implemented:
- ✅ Spotify audio features API integration
- ✅ BPM extraction and synchronization
- ✅ Metadata overlay with artwork and track info
- ✅ BPM pulse generator for visual sync
- ✅ GUI controls for BPM sync
- ✅ Automatic track change detection
- ✅ Bass reactivity fallback when BPM sync disabled
- ✅ Non-intrusive overlay design
- ✅ Performance: polling doesn't impact 60fps

### Next Steps:
- Apply BPM sync to individual scenes (LogoScene, SoundBars, etc.)
- Use `audioBands.bpm` for precise beat-synchronized effects
- Consider adding beat visualization indicators
- Test with various BPM ranges (60-180 BPM)
